## 📊 Push_Swap - 1337 School Project 📈
Welcome to my Push_Swap repository! This project challenges you to implement an efficient sorting algorithm using two stacks with a limited set of operations. The goal is to sort a list of integers with the fewest number of operations, testing your algorithmic skills and optimization capabilities. 🚀

---

## Project Overview 📊
The Push_Swap project involves sorting a list of integers using two stacks: stack_a and stack_b. You can only use the following operations to manipulate the stacks:

Stack Operations 🔄
- Push (pa, pb): Push the top element of one stack to the other. ⬆️⬇️
- Swap (sa, sb, ss): Swap the top two elements of one stack or both stacks. 🔀
- Rotate (ra, rb, rr): Rotate the elements of one stack or both stacks (move the top element to the bottom). 🔄
- Reverse Rotate (rra, rrb, rrr): Reverse rotate the elements of one stack or both stacks (move the bottom element to the top). 🔁

---

## Goal 🎯
The challenge is to implement an algorithm that sorts the numbers in stack_a with the fewest operations possible.

---

## Key Features ✨
- Efficient Sorting: Sort integers using two stacks with minimal operations. 📊
- Operations: Implement all the allowed stack operations (Push, Swap, Rotate, Reverse Rotate). 🔧
- Chunk-Based Sorting: For large inputs, divide the data into chunks and sort them progressively. 🧩
- Optimized Algorithm: Focus on reducing the number of operations required for sorting. ⚡
